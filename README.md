# yoneda-in-tongues
The project: state the [Yoneda lemma](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma) in every known language.
Contribute, acknowledge yourself, sign your translation (and provide, if you want, a proof of your knowledge of the language you write in!).

Some simple rules:

* The "simple English" translation constitutes a base ("the base translation", in the following), for the moment. This is obviously an arbitrary convention to maximize the availability of the text;
* Keep it simple; avoid subordination; preserve the structure of the phrase in the base translation.
* Provide references for technical words (what is the right translation for "functor" in Quenya?), and propose, propose, propose.
* Unusual language are more than welcome (Ithkuil anybody?)
* The project uses XeLaTeX; the mainfont is Quivira (http://www.quivira-font.com/); keep the latest version in the fonts/ folder!
* You speak Xhosa, nice to know. But maybe somebody around you can provide another translation. Cooperate. Discuss. Re-read what is already written.
