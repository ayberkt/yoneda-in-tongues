# yoneda-in-tongues
The project: state the Yoneda lemma in every known language.
Contribute, acknowledge yourself, sign your translation (and provide, if you want, a proof of your knowledge of the language you write in!).

Some simple rules:

* The "simple English" translation constitutes a base ("the base translation", in the following), for the moment. This is obviously an arbitrary convention to maximize the availability of the text.
* Keep it simple; avoid subordination.
* Preserve the structure of the phrase in the base translation.
* Provide references for technical words (what is the right translation for "functor" in Quenya?), and propose, propose, propose.
* Unusual language are more than welcome (Ithkuil anybody?)
